    contents: (
      <div>
        There is no single medical or genetic test to identify ASD. However
        professionals may carry out an evaluation or assessment using diagnostic
        tools such as Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or Autism
        Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) to identify ASD. The child will
        be evaluated across a range of skill development, including
        communication, social, motor and cognitive development.In some cases,
        the child may shows signs of autism early as 8 months. Many children
        with ASD may also have another medical or psychiatric conditions and
        this is referred to as comorbidity. Conditions that are commonly
        comorbid with autism are ADHD, anxiety, depression, sensory
        sensitivities, Intellectual Disability (ID), Touretteâ€™s syndrome and a
        differential diagnosis is done to rule them out.
